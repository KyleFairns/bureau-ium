**BU**siness **RE**adable **AU**tomation
 
 An abstraction library for Selenium and Frisby.js with simplifying
 the automation code in mind. It allows us to chain actions (including waits as standard), 
 making the process of writing test code faster. Self documenting and easy to use, this library
 is perfect for those learning automation, and those experienced in it.
 
 Using promises and asynchronous functionality, it captures some of the more 
 common errors, includes a functional library to interact with elements, 
 navigate with and send api requests to urls, and transforms the bureau-ium.config.json 
 for use elsewhere
